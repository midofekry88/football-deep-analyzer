Objective:

Analyze the next match for the two teams against each other using a structured dataset where each row represents a single team, and each match is represented by two rows (one for each team). Use this dataset to predict:

1. Expected Goals – Team 1


2. Expected Goals – Team 2


3. Total Match Goals


4. Double Chance (Win or Draw)


5. Total Match Fouls


6. Total Corners
